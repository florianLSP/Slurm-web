== Components

This diagram represents all Slurm-web components with their respective roles and
integration with Slurm workload manager:

Slurm-web is based on 3 components:

* *agent*: Sends requests to Slurm `slurmrestd` service which exposes a REST
  API for `slurmctld` and `slurmdbd` daemons. The _agent_ is also in charge of
  the _authorizations_ enforcement and acts as a _caching_ layer over Slurm.
* *gateway*: Performs _user authentication_ and acts as a _reserve proxy_ for
  the _agents_.
* *frontend*: The _representation layer_ for the user interface. It is actually
  served by the _gateway_ application and executed on client side in web
  browsers.

== Integration

In addition to Slurm workload manager, Slurm-web interacts with some other
external services and data sources:

image::arch/slurm-web_integration.png[]

The *gateway* component authenticates users with an entreprise LDAP
directory. Slurm-web supports all major LDAP services implementation such as
OpenLDAP, FreeIPA and Active Directory with legacy NIS and RFC 2307 bis schemas.

The *agent* component reads the
xref:conf:policy.adoc[RBAC autorization policy] from a plain INI file with
permissions associated to roles and LDAP groups. The component also extracts
cluster racking topology from xref:racksdb:overview:start.adoc[RacksDB] database
to generate
xref:overview.adoc#nodes-status[graphical representation of nodes status] in the
racks. Finally, it connects to https://redis.io/[Redis] in-memory key/value
database to save cached data from Slurm.

[#protocols]
== Protocols

Protocols and authentication realms used for communication between Slurm-web and
Slurm components are represented in this diagram:

.Protocols in communication between Slurm-web components [xref:image$arch/slurm-web_protocols.svg[icon:download[] SVG]]
image::arch/slurm-web_protocols.png[]

All communications from the clients web browsers to Slurm-web *agent*
component are performed with HTTP over TCP/IP network protocols. These
network communications can be secured with SSL/TLS (aka. HTTPS) over standard
port TCP/443 with a xref:conf:wsgi/index.adoc[production HTTP server]. After
initial authentication with LDAP directory, users are authenticated between
these components with https://jwt.io/[JSON Web Token] (JWT).

Communications between *agent* component and Slurm `slurmrestd` daemon are
performed with HTTP protocol over a Unix socket.

NOTE: Slurm `slurmrestd` supports incoming connections on TCP/IP sockets but
this configuration is not yet supported by Slurm-web. This is currently a
limitation in Slurm-web that might change in the future.

Slurm components communicates with specific binary RPC protocol over TCP/IP
sockets. Communications between the *agent* and Slurm components are secured
and user are authenticated with https://dun.github.io/munge/[Munge].

[#multiclusters]
== Multi-clusters Distribution

Slurm-web is designed to support natively multiple HPC clusters with a central
dashboard. In this configuration, the components are distributed as represented
in this diagram:

.Slurm-web distribution on multiple clusters [xref:image$arch/slurm-web_distribution.svg[icon:download[] SVG]]
image::arch/slurm-web_distribution.png[]

In this configuration, the *agent* component must be deployed on all clusters
collocated with Slurm `slurmrestd` daemon. An *agent* interacts with only one
Slurm cluster.

The *gateway* can be installed on a central server. It distributes the requests
to the *agents* deployed on the clusters.

[#slurm-versions]
== Slurm REST API versions

Slurm-web {version} is officially tested and supported with Slurm REST API
*v0.0.39*. This version of Slurm REST API is available in Slurm 23.02, 23.11 and
24.05.

This table represents all Slurm REST API versions supported by the latest Slurm
releases:

NOTE: While Slurm-web is officially tested with a specific version of Slurm REST
API, there are actually few changes between API versions (see
{slurmrestd-release-notes}[Slurm OpenAPI plugin release notes] for details) so
there are chances that it works with other versions. This can be tested by
setting `[slurmrestd]>version` the in _agent_ configuration file. Use it at your
own risk!
