= Authorization Policy

Slurm-web offers the possibility to manage permissions to access data with
fine-grain role-based access control (RBAC) authorization policy. The
authorization policy is enforced at _agent_ level. In
xref:overview:architecture.adoc#multiclusters[multi-clusters mode], policies can
be different on all clusters.

Slurm-web permissions are independent of Slurm permissions (ex: privatedata,
coordinators, operators, etcâ€¦). For example, users can have the permission to
view reservations in Slurm-web but not in Slurm and vice-versa. Users can even
have permissions in Slurm-web without any permission on Slurm cluster.

Slurm-web _agent_ component is installed with a default vendor authorization
policy defined in file [.path]#`/usr/share/slurm-web/conf/policy.ini`#. This
default policy gives _anonymous_ users some permissions and authenticated users
a bit more permissions.

CAUTION: Do not edit this default vendor authorization policy, or your changes
will be lost on next Slurm-web upgrades!

A site specific policy can be defined in configuration file
[.path]#`/etc/slurm-web/policy.ini`#. When this file is created, the default
vendor policy is ignored.

== File Format

The authorization policy is an INI file with different sections described below.

=== Roles Members

The file must have one `[roles]` section to define roles and their memberships.
In this section:

* Keys are arbitrary *name of roles*,
* Values are comma separated list of LDAP *users* and *groups* associated to
  this role. The groups names must be prefixed by `@`. Special value `ALL` can
  be used to designate all users authenticated on LDAP directory.

A special role name is `anonymous`. When this role is defined, it is
automatically assigned to all users when authentication is disabled on Slurm-web
_gateway_. The key of this special role does not have to be associated to a
value.

Arbitrary number of roles can be defined.

=== Roles Permissions

Sections must be defined for every roles defined in `[roles]` section. All these
sections must have an `actions` key. The value assigned to this key is the
comma-separated <<#actions,list of actions>> granted to the role.

=== Examples

[%collapsible]
====
[source,ini]

[roles]
# Members of scientists have the user role

# Members of it group have the the admin role
admin=@it

[user]
actions=view-stats,view-jobs,view-accounts

[admin]
actions=view-nodes,view-partitions,view-qos,view-reservations
----

Two roles are defined in this authorization policy:

* *user* role is assigned to all members of _rd_ and _it_ LDAP groups. Users
  with this role have permissions on `view-stats`, `view-jobs` and
  `view-accounts` actions.
* *admin* role is assigned to all members of _it_ LDAP group. Users with this
  role haves permissions on `view-nodes`, `view-partitions`, `view-qos` and
  `view-reservations` actions.

Members of _it_ group inherit both *user* and *admin* roles with the union of
all granted actions.

----

Anonymous role is enabled in this authorization policy. It is assigned to all
users when authentication is disabled in Slurm-web gateway. This role is only
granted the `view-stats` action.

Two other roles are defined in this authorization policy:

* *user* role is assigned to all users authenticated on LDAP directory. This
  role gives permissions on `view-stats`, `view-jobs` and `view-accounts`
  actions.
* *admin* role is assigned to all members of _it_ LDAP group and _jdoe_
  individual user. Users with this role haves permissions on `view-nodes`,
  `view-partitions`, `view-qos` and `view-reservations` actions.

Members of _it_ group and _jdoe_ inherit both *user* and *admin* roles with the
union of all granted actions.
